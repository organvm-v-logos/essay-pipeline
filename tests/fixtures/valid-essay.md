# A Perfectly Valid Test Essay

This is the body of a valid essay. It has enough words to be meaningful, discusses the organ system, references specific repos, and meets all structural requirements defined in the frontmatter schema.

## Section Two

More content here to pad the word count for testing purposes. The validator checks frontmatter, not body structure, so this section exists primarily for the indexer's word-count computation.
